# Kata.HolidaySearch
Interview kata (Feb 2025)

## Future Development / Final Notes
* Holiday/Flight searches could be run asynchronously or in parallel 
* IQueryable would be more suitable for equivalent real world scenario against larger datasets, but IEnumerable performant enough for provided sample data. 
* No guards or tests around filtering that result in no results
* Current test suites all focused around happy path, would flesh out more test cases with more time
* I kept toying with the idea of introducing an enum for the location codes but it never seemed necessary. Would be helpful for validation around location input.
* There's probably a chance to make naming more consistent with destinations. I'm not sure why I didn't change `To` and `From` early in the development


## Holiday Search
Taking the two JSON files of flights and hotels as source data, please create a
small library of code that provides a basic holiday search feature.
The holiday search results should be ordered such that the first result should
be the best value holiday we can provide, based on the customers
requirements.

Use the test cases listed below to verify the success of your work, add more
tests as you see fit.

Here is an example of how the finished library could work, you're welcome to
put your own spin on it.

```
var holidaySearch = new HolidaySearch({
DepartingFrom: 'MAN',
TravelingTo: 'AGP',
DepartureDate: '2023/07/01'
Duration: 7
});
holidaySearch.Results.First() # Returns the Best of the matching results
holidaySearch.Results.First().TotalPrice # 'Â£900.00'
holidaySearch.Results.First().Flight.Id # 4
holidaySearch.Results.First().Flight.DepartingFrom # 'MAN'
holidaySearch.Results.First().Flight.TravalingTo # 'AGP'
holidaySearch.Results.First().Flight.Price
holidaySearch.Results.First().Hotel.Id # 3
holidaySearch.Results.First().Hotel.Name
holidaySearch.Results.First().Hotel.Price
```
